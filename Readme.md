Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context.

1. What is Execution context ? 

--  Two Key Components of an Execution Context:
1. Variable Enviorment (Memory Component)
    Stores variable, function declearation and parameters
    it's also include the lexcial enviorment and the scope chain
2. Thread of Excuation (Code Component)
    this is the order in which the code runs, line by line
    javascript is single threaded, meaning it excuates code line by line
